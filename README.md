# Pre-Built Wizard

## Overview

This contains modular workflows that operate when integrated with the app-artifacts application that can be installed within IAP. Once installed teams will be able to quickly automate common manual tasks such as creating a Pre-Built artifact.json file made up of IAP components, saving a significant amount of time and effort. This library can be used as modular components with other libraries and automations to build comprehensive end-to-end orchestrated workflows with Itential's low-code platform.
